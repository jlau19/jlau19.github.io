For this <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-preparing-for-WOD.html">Technical Essay</a>, I'm going to talk about my experiences with performing the WOD <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">Invoice 1</a>. I took my previous advice in preparing for this WOD by looking at the instructions prior to my first attempt. I tried my best to understand what I needed to do and also to visualize how I was going to do it. I planned out some codes to use in my head, and for something more complicated for me I would refer back to the previous lab and tutorials. It took me four tries this time to make Rx time. I think my goal is always to aim for that even if it takes me an extra try or two to get there, because I consider all the previous times practices in order for me to do the same things more smoothly, and doing this is how the things I learn can stick with me. 

The first two times when I was trying to do it on my own, I ran into different obstacles such as forgetting to change item numbers or something similar. The most difficult part for me was not knowing to put the script tags within the subtotal, sales tax, and grand total cells. I tried to encompass the entire rows but I could not make it work. This was when I checked the solution and realized what I was missing, so I tried again and made it just outside Rx time. When I did my final try I finally could do it smoothly, and also cleaned up on some things such as semicolons.

I want to do the next WOD without looking at the solution, because whenever I can figure out things without looking at the answers, it feels like I accomplished more. Maybe I could spend some more time going over certain readings and tutorials pertaining to the WOD prior to doing it. Some things tend to stick with me more so when I do my readings, maybe I could spend extra time on things that are slightly more difficult for me.
