My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:<br>
-I feel that I definitely got a lot better when it comes to syntax, since I haven't felt the need to look them up as I used to before. At the beginning of the semester, it was quite a bit to intake but I think up until now, all the labs and WODs helped me improve because it was a lot of practicing. I also think that I improved on troubleshooting/debugging my codes. I can make slightly more complex functions and be able to play around with them until I get what I want, and understand more of why certain things work and don't work. Overall, I'm happy about my progress because I could not do those things before.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:<br>
-I think there is still a long way ahead of me, beacause even though I have a better understanding of things, it still takes me a while sometimes to put together a code that does what I want it to do. For example, it took me a while to fix certain parts of my code in Assignment 1, when I probably could have fixed it quicker. This might be from certain confusions I might have had. What I should do in the future is probably to take more time to understand what each line of each function of my code does prior to testing it right away.

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.<br>
-I try to always start my WODs at least without looking at the solutions, and if I really got stuck, then I looked. Sometimes I can do most parts of a WOD without checking, and after I'm done, I would check to see how different mine is compared to the solution. This helped me understand better if I'm wrong or if I needed to format my code better.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.<br>
-Yes I think most of the time I do all my readings first before checking out a lab, and some parts I might be confused, but I think they're doable as long as I'm caught up with my readings for the lab. It's especially helpful when I can follow along the particularly challenging parts during class, and then try to figure out the more complex extra credits on my own.

I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).<br>
-Yes! Assignment 1 was fun and I enjoyed it.

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:<br>
-I know this couldn't be helped given the current situation, but I think especially towards the beginning few weeks of the semester it would have been extremely helpful to get regularly updated grades and feedback on all the labs/WODs/essays. This is because if I was doing poorly in the beginning or not doing my labs/WODs right, I could have changed the way I did things. I admit that I was slightly anxious not knowing how I was doing in this class for a while, but I trusted that I was okay since I was keeping up with all my work. 

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:<br>
-Definitely doing all my readings before a lab. There were maybe two times where I wasn't completely caught up with my readings, and I struggled more to follow along during the labs in class. However, other times where I tried to gain more understandings of the material before going into class, I'm able to follow along much better and have a better learning experience because it gets me thinking a lot more instead of just copying whatever I see in class without understanding. I also really appreciated the screencast that helped me get started on Assignment 1, I find all screencasts to be really helpful for my own learning.
