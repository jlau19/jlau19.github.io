<b>1. What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?</b><br>
I think in my project I accomplished pretty much what I planned for the most part, now that I'm looking back at the Assignment 3 Prototype that I created towards the beginning of the assignment. In the prototype, I mapped out all the different pages I wanted in my application, and the flow of which pages to be redirected to for certain clicks. My assignment turned out almost just as how I wanted it to, with a few minor changes to design.
<br><br>

<b>2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</b><br>
I think one thing I should have done was to implement a feature to remove items one by one in the cart instead of removing all cart data.
<br><br>

<b>3. What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?</b><br>
My biggest project risk was that at some point, I tried to redesign my entire store, such as the file structuring/architecture and I was going to display my products and pages in a completely different way. I ended up making multiple copies of my assignment, then testing many different things and seeing what works and what doesn't. I ultimately stuck with my original design because it was something I was most familiar with and worked better for me.
<br><br>

<b>4. What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?</b><br>
I think this system is decent from what I can tell, because it meets all the major requirements and I think most of the minor requirements as well. It didn't seem to give me any errors or bugs when I tested the final version on my local server or the class server.
<br><br>

<b>5. What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?</b><br>
I think this system could use a more attractive overall layout/design. I think it looks good now but maybe it could be prettier or more eye-catching. Also, as I mentioned above, the ability to remove items one by one in the shopping cart instead of clearing all the data. Maybe some of the extra credit items that I missed could be implemented just for even better quality.
<br><br>

<b>6. Describe what you are most proud of about this project:</b><br>
I'm proud that I spent a long time working on the project and it finally paid off. At some point, I didn't even think I was going to finish on time only because I encountered so many issues with the major requirements and the deadline was looming ever so quickly. Fortunately, I was able to attend the workshops and got help from Professor Port during that time, and I really needed that push in the right direction because it was something small that did wonders for the rest of my coding with the assignment. I'm proud that I was able to figure out a lot of the problems by myself afterwards because that means that I learned.
<br><br>

<b>7. Describe what you are least happy with this project:</b><br>
I'm least happy with how long I've spent being stuck on one problem. I think I wasted a lot of time at some point trying to make one thing work while nothing else works, when I should have just moved on and then come back another time or get help on that issue. I think it really would have saved me a lot of time but I really wanted to keep trying, and that ended up working against me.
<br><br>

<b>8. Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. "I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization"):</b><br>
I contributed 100% because I did not work with a partner.
