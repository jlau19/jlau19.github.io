With the first WOD, BroswerHistory1, it took me four tries to get it right. In the first two tries, I took way longer than the DNF time. I think this is because I wasn't as prepared as I should have been: I wasn't caught up on my readings as I should have been, I didn't read the WOD instructions or skim through the basics of what I was getting into, so the screen recording did not look smooth at all. When I got stuck or ended up with different codes, I looked at the solution video and wanted to make my code the same way because I thought I needed the same code as the solution in order to make the page look right. I learned in the next WODs that these exercises are something I can do on my own even if my codes are not exactly as the solutions'.

The second WOD, BrowserHistory2, is by far the best one I've done so far. This is because I did it completely on my own without looking at the solution at all and the page still turned out the way it was supposed to. My first try was within the average time frame, but I wanted to make Rx time, so I did it a second time and it went smoother. When I was done, I looked at the solution and saw there were slight differences, but I did not change my code since it was already fine. I think this was more successful compared to my first WOD because I took some extra time to read through the instructions, and I made sure I was caught up on my readings and tutorials of HTML and CSS.

The third WOD was a bit more difficult for me and it took me three attempts to make sure the page looked as it should and that I was within Rx time. When I was stuck, I did not look at the solution but referred back to the CSS tutorials from the readings instead, and tried out the codes that I remembered from there. After I was done and looked at the solution, there were even more differences but again, my page looked the way it should so I didn't change it just to match the solution.

Overall, I think I'm a lot more comfortable with HTML and CSS basics, especially after the second and third WODs. I think this is because I took time to make sure I was prepared and was caught up with the readings. Compared to the very first WOD, things went smoother as I kept practicing. Based on my experiences with this so far, my best recommendation is to read all the readings and tutorials and to be prepared. Even if your code doesn't look the same as the solution's, just test it and see because it just may work. You don't have to rely on the solutions too much, trust in the process and practice!
