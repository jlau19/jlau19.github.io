Aloha, my name is Jojo and I major in MIS. Prior to MIS, I've switched what I wanted to major in a few times since I did not know what I wanted to do. I took classes towards journalism, kinesiology, and physical therapy, before finally realizing that MIS is what I really want to study.

What really drove me towards MIS was gaining work experience in the field. Aside from attending school, I was also in the military. My occupational specialty was in the signal and communications field, which helped me gain insights in IT/IS along the way. I was fascinated by it, and my peers were influential. While I was in the military, I decided to gain more experience doing tech support work at Farrington High School. I still work there to this day and I really love my job there, from helping others with troubleshooting, to training users and helping manage IT/IS in the school. I also like that I am constantly learning on the job, so I ultimately decided to further my education in this field.
